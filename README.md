### Confirmation Pop-up: 
Upon successful booking submission, users receive a professional and friendly pop-up notification confirming their booking. The notification displays the name of the booked horse and includes a thank you message. Additionally, users receive a professional calendar invite for their scheduled horse riding session.

### UI/UX Design: 
Designed using Figma, the project includes wireframes, high-fidelity mockups, and an interactive prototype. The design emphasizes a friendly and inviting color scheme with soothing tones, clean and legible typography, and high-quality images of the horses. Smooth transitions and animations enhance the user experience.

### State Management:
